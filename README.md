# 🤖 Memory-based AI Chatbot  

This is my Python project!  
I built a memory-based chatbot that uses the **Groq API** with the **LLaMA-3 model** to interact with users.  
The chatbot remembers past conversations during a session, making replies more natural and contextual.  

## 📌 Project Objective  
To create an AI-powered chatbot that:  
- Can hold multi-turn conversations.  
- Remembers chat history within a session.  
- Runs both in terminal and with a Streamlit-based UI.  

## ✨ Project Features  
- **Conversation Memory:** Stores previous messages for context-aware replies.  
- **Terminal Mode:** Simple CLI chatbot (`chatbot.py`).  
- **Notebook Version:** Experimentation in Jupyter (`main.ipynb`).  
- **Streamlit UI:** Interactive chat interface (`app.py`).  
- **Environment Variables:** API key managed securely with `.env`.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python 🐍**  
- Requests → API calls  
- Dotenv → Environment variable management  
- Streamlit → Web UI  
- Jupyter Notebook → Code experimentation  

## 📂 Project Files  
- `chatbot.py` → main chatbot code (terminal)  
- `main.ipynb` → notebook version for testing  
- `app.py` → Streamlit UI version  
- `.env` → API key storage (not uploaded)  
- `requirements.txt` → required dependencies  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/she-readzs/Memory-based-AI-Chatbot.git
   cd Memory-based-AI-Chatbot
